    <h1>Alex's Intro Page</h1>
    
    <p>Hi, my name is Alex Bayer and I am excited to be in IDN 530!</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>

    <p>BSN from Quinnipiac University School of Nursing</p>

    <h2>Bio</h2>

    <p>A little bit about me: I just graduated from Quinnipiac University School of Nursing 
        with my BSN and I'll be starting at St. Francis Hospital in the Emergency Department in July.
        I started in the IDN program in the fall of 2024 during my undergrad as a 4+1 student when I knew I wanted to continue
        my education journey after graduation. I'm passionate about Emergency Medicine education and wanted to build up my tool box for content development. 
        I'm excited to continue my IDN journey in IDN530!
