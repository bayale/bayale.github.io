        <h2>Chapter 1: The Signal Fades</h2>
        <p>It was a quiet morning in North Haven. Birds chirped, coffee brewed, and <i>I thought</i> it would be a good idea to toy around with my networking settings. <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Hardware plugged in and wired &#x2714</li>
                <li>DHCP server configured &#x2714</li>
                <li>LAN & WLAN settings configured &#x2714</li>
                <li>NAS installed &#x2714</li>
            </ul>
            Then, suddenly, <strong>the WiFi went out.</strong></p>

        <h2>Chapter 2: The Search</h2>
        <p>Panic insued, fear washed over me. <i>Rapidly,</i> I searched for what I broke. The router blinked silently, offering no comfort.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="chapter3">
        <h2>The culprit:</h2>
        <p>It was the subnet mask settings, I put /24 instead of /23. <strong>Whoops.</strong> Also the WiFi didn't actually go down, I'm just being dramatic. But I couldn't connect to my NAS and that was moderatly frustrating.</p>

      <h3>Aside:</h3>
      <p>Some would suggest I just read a manual or watch a video first, but where's the <strong>fun</strong> in that!</p>
