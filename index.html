    <p>Hello World</p>
    <p>Hi, my name is Alex Bayer and I am excited to be in IDN 530!</p>

    <p>A little bit about me: I just graduated from Quinnipiac with my BSN 
        and I'll be starting at St. Francis Hospital in the Emergency Department in July.
        I'm excited to continue my IDN journey in IDN530!
    </p>
    
    <p>This is a picture of me from Graduation on May 10th!</p>
